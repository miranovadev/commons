# Participation API

The participation endpoint is scoped to a Substrate and Participant:

- GET /api/substrates/{substrate}/participants/{participant}/participate
- POST /api/substrates/{substrate}/participants/{participant}/participate
- POST /api/substrates/{substrate}/participants/{participant}/participate/enter

GET returns a resumable state. A ready state contains the active Cycle, the
current input plan and the Participant's Perspective bounds. Expected
incomplete states, such as a Cycle awaiting Potential selection, return a
successful response with status waiting and a machine-readable reason.

When a substrate has no proposition history, the waiting state advertises an
available `origin` entry. POSTing to `/participate/enter` with the Origin
statement, an Attestation and a Receipt instrument atomically establishes the
first Committal Proposition. Its bootstrap observables produce the initial
Closure Boundary, and the response places the Participant in a live Distinguish
Phase in the Settlement `signal` register.

    {
      "origin": {
        "statement": "The first commitment.",
        "attestation": {
          "direction": "support",
          "rationale": "Why this is a sound beginning."
        },
        "instrument": {
          "kind": "hyperlink",
          "reference": "https://example.test/evidence"
        }
      }
    }

Origin entry is serialized on the Substrate. A concurrent or repeated request
receives HTTP 409 and cannot create a second Origin. Entry to an established
substrate remains reserved for the future Potential selector and is exposed as
an unavailable `potential` entry rather than guessed by the client.

POST applies exactly one contribution:

    {
      "phase_id": "01...",
      "contribution": {
        "action": "proposition.variant",
        "statement": "A new distinction."
      }
    }

The phase ID is a concurrency token. A stale or repeated submission receives
HTTP 409 and cannot progress the Phase twice. The contribution, its ledger
entries, Phase completion and creation of the next Phase share one database
transaction.

The contribution object is validated against the JSON Schema returned in the
current plan. The React interface uses the same schema to render its controls.

Perspective includes an explicit Attenuation placeholder. It currently carries
pending status and null value/distance fields so the eventual decay projection
can be added without changing the participation response shape.
